            <h2>What is Immunobullous?</h2>
            <p>Immunobullous diseases encompass a group of rare yet impactful autoimmune disorders that affect the skin and mucous membranes. Characterized by the body's immune system mistakenly attacking healthy tissue, these conditions result in the formation of fluid-filled blisters and erosions on the skin and mucosal surfaces. Immunobullous diseases can vary in severity and presentation, with notable examples including pemphigus vulgaris, bullous pemphigoid, and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. Understanding the complex interplay between the immune system and skin integrity is crucial in diagnosing and managing these conditions effectively, often requiring a multidisciplinary approach involving dermatologists, immunologists, and other healthcare specialists. Early detection, proper diagnosis, and tailored treatment regimens are paramount in mitigating the impact of immunobullous diseases on patients' quality of life.</p>
